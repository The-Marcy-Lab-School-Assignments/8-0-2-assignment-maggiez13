# Question

What is the danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend? How does making an API request from the server avoid this danger?

# Answer

When making API requests with API keys from the frontend, the key is exposed in the client-side code, which can be accessed by anyone using the browser's developer tools, in the Network tab. This poses a significant security risk because users could potentially misuse the API key, leading to issues like unauthorized access, exceeding API usage limits, or even compromising sensitive data.

By making API requests from the server, the API key remains hidden from the public and is securely handled. Since the server-side code is not exposed to the user, it protects the API key from being accessed or misused. This approach ensures that the key remains private and only the server communicates directly with the external API, adding a layer of security to the application.
